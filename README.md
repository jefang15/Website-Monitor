# Website-Monitor
Website scraping and monitoring

Scrapes websites to avoid needing to manually refresh the page and identify what changed. The scraping is set on a timer and the scripts send a notification whenever there is a notable change on the website. Sample applications include scraping and monitoring a dog adoption website and sends an email whenever a new dog is available for adoption or gets adopted and includes their photo. Similarly, this scrapes an apartment's website and notifies the user whenever a new unit becomes available on the market or an existing unit changes prices and indicates what the change in price was.
